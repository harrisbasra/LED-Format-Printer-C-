This program written in C++ takes an integer input from the user and outputs the corresponding number in LED light format. 
The program uses a linked list to store the different LED light patterns for each number from 0 to 9. 
It then loops through the input integer, determines the LED pattern for each digit, and prints the pattern on the console.

The LED patterns are represented using ASCII characters to simulate the appearance of LED lights. 
Each number is represented by a 3x3 grid of characters, with each "on" LED represented by an asterisk (*) and each "off" LED represented by a period (.). 
The output is a series of 3x3 grids printed on the console that together form the complete LED representation of the input integer.
